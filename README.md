# Introduction

**MediaPipe4U** provides a suite of libraries and tools that allow you to quickly apply artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques to your Unreal Engine projects. You can integrate these solutions into your UE project immediately and customize them to meet your needs. The suite includes motion capture, facial expression capture for your 3D avatar, text-to-speech (TTS), speech recognition (ASR), and more. All features are real-time, offline, low-latency, and easy to use.

# What's news

Speech Model download move to [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/endink/M4U-Speech-Models/tree/main).   

> Currently, only the Unreal Engine 5.5 version is available; Other versions will be packaged and released later, sorry for that.


# Known Issues:    
- The new Google Holistic Task API does not support GPU inference. As a result, the Android platform relies on CPU inference, while Windows continues to use CPU inference as usual.  
- Starting from Unreal Engine **5.4**, the built-in `OpenCV` plugin no longer includes precompiled libraries (DLL files). Upon the first launch of the UE Editor, since M4U depends on the `OpenCV` plugin, the editor will attempt to download the `OpenCV` source code online and compile it on your machine. This process may take a significant amount of time, potentially giving the impression that the engine is stuck at 75% during loading. Please be patient and check the logs in the *Saved* directory under the root folder to verify whether the process has completed. For users in China, you may need a VPN connection. Alternatively, you can follow the steps outlined in [#166](https://github.com/endink/Mediapipe4u-plugin/discussions/166) to manually resolve this issue.

> Because the plugin is precompiled and contains a large number of C++ link symbols and debug symbols, it will cost **10G** disk space after decompression (most files are UE-generated binaries in Intermediate).   
> Don't need to worry about disk usage, this is just disk usage during development, after the project is packaged, the plug-in disk usage is **300M** only (most files are GStreamer dynamic library and speech models).

# Cross Platform    

Now, M4U support Android and Windows (Linux is coming soom)

If you have any questiongs, please check [FAQ](./faq) first. The problems listed there may be also yours. If you can’t find an answer in the FAQ, please post an issue. Private message or emal may cause the question to be mised .

# Performance

Since the Windows version of MediaPipe does not support GPU inference, Windows relies on the CPU to inferring human pose estimation (see MediaPipe offical site for more details).


**Evaluation** 

Frame Rate： 18-24 fps 

CPU usage：20% (Based on DEMO project)  

**Testing Evnrioment**

CPU： AMD 3600 CPU   
RAM: 32GB   
GPU: Nvidia 1660s
